# Prompt

can you write me a program in golang that generates prime numbers?

# Response

Certainly! Here's an example program in Golang that generates prime numbers:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Enter the limit up to which prime numbers are to be found: ")
    var limit int
    fmt.Scanln(&limit)

    primes := make([]bool, limit+1)
    for i := 2; i <= limit; i++ {
        primes[i] = true
    }

    for p := 2; p*p <= limit; p++ {
        if primes[p] {
            for i := p * p; i <= limit; i += p {
                primes[i] = false
            }
        }
    }

    fmt.Println("Prime numbers up to", limit, "are:")
    for p := 2; p <= limit; p++ {
        if primes[p] {
            fmt.Println(p)
        }
    }
}
```

The program prompts the user to enter a limit up to which prime numbers are to be found. It then creates a boolean array of size limit+1 to represent whether each number is prime or not, and initializes all elements to true.

The program then loops through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the limit, marking all multiples of each prime number as not prime. Finally, the program prints out all prime numbers up to the limit.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
